## 1. Healthcare provider Fraud Detection

#### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to " predict the potentially fraudulent providers " based on the claims filed by them.along with this, we will also discover important variables helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraud providers. further, we will study fraudulent patterns in the provider's claims to understand the future behaviour of providers.

#### Introduction to the Dataset
For the purpose of this project, we are considering Inpatient claims, Outpatient claims and Beneficiary details of each provider. Lets s see their details :

#### A) Inpatient Data

This data provides insights about the claims filed for those patients who are admitted in the hospitals. It also provides additional details like their admission and discharge dates and admit d diagnosis code.

#### B) Outpatient Data

This data provides details about the claims filed for those patients who visit hospitals and not admitted in it.

#### C) Beneficiary Details Data

This data contains beneficiary KYC details like health conditions,regioregion they belong to etc.

### Data Analysis:
understand the 4 datasets which are ,,, identify the missing values 
perform the Exploratory Data Analysis to 

### Feature Engineering 
Create new features form combination of a exsiting feature 
derive Average features grouped according to columns of datasets.
we can use certain methods to identify clues of fraud and abuse. One such simple method is 'Grouping based on Similarity'. In this method, we basically group all the records by the ProcedureCodes, DiagnosisCodes,Provider.
Average Features based on grouping variables. Average features grouped by Provider

Average Feature based on grouping based on combinations of different variables.


### Data Preprocessing 

### Standardization 

### Train-Test Validation split

### Model Building and prediction
Appiled multiple machine learning Models such as LogisticRegression, Support vector machine, Adaboosting, Decision tree, 
GradientBoosting, xGBoosting. 

### Model Evalution 
we have used precision, recall, f1- scores

### Feature Importance 
Studied behaviour of Providers and found following important features impactful in predicting Fraud/NonFraud are folowing:

1) PerProviderAvg_InscClaimAmtReimbursed( Importance: 8%)

2) InscClaimAmtReimbursed (Importance: 7%)

3) PerAttendingPhysicianAvg_InscClaimAmtReimbursed (Importance: 7%)

4) PerOperatingPhysicianAvg_InscClaimAmtReimbursed (Importance: 6%)

5) PerClmAdmitDiagnosisCodeAvg_InscClaimAmtReimbursed (Importance: 4%)
